        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I am Vaibhavy Darshan, living in Rochester, New York. Growing up, I loved creating new things, primarily through art. However, as I went to the Rochester Institute of Technology for Game Design and Development, I learned how to make interactive experiences.<br>
        It had expanded the way I perceived art as I made games, websites, and console applications. Through this website, I wanted to give a sneak peek of some of my best works.</p>

            This project is inspired by Rick and Mortyâ€™s Wiki page. I wanted to make an informative search engine where users can filter results to find the characters they are looking for. It is my favorite show, and I wanted to incorporate it into one of my academic projects. I made it with Rick and Morty API using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

        <p>Made with <a href="https://pixijs.com/">PIXI</a> and Javascript, this online game is made for young girls to dress up a mannequin.
        They could play music for some company as they drag and drop some items on the mannequin while clicking to choose shoes for fun.

        <p>It was a semester-long project made in Monogame using C sharp. It is a stealth platformer game made with three classmates- Edward Choi, Sean Bethel, and Hyunwoo Park. I contributed to this project by managing the timeline of the tasks, maintaining work sessions, and developing the firing system and enemy movement. It was a fun experience as I got to play around with pathfinding and how to make enemy movements more natural.</p>

        <h2>Suburbs</h2>
        <p>Inspired by Rick and Morty, I built a low poly Suburban environment using an A-frame JavaScript, HTML, and CSS library. In fact, I made a one-page website to explain how I did this project for one of my class assignments.<br>
