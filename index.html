                    <p>
                        I developed a Game of Life simulation using C# for an academic project. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the mathematician John Conway, where cells evolve based on predefined rules. My implementation utilized object-oriented programming principles and advanced data structures to create a dynamic and interactive simulation.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Game of Life project showcases several key features aimed at enhancing user experience and functionality. It includes a Random Board Generation feature, allowing for the creation of diverse initial board configurations with unique starting patterns for each simulation run. The Display Board functionality provides users with a visual representation of the evolving cellular automaton, enabling them to observe the state of the game board in real-time. Additionally, File I/O Operations have been implemented to facilitate loading and saving game configurations from external files, empowering users to specify custom starting patterns and save their progress for future sessions. The project also incorporates Advanced Simulation Logic, employing complex algorithms and 2D array manipulation techniques to implement the core rules of the Game of Life, including cell survival, birth, and death. Furthermore, Extra Credit Features, such as calculating the percentage of live cells on the board and automatically resetting the board under certain conditions, have been included to enhance the overall functionality and user experience of the application.</p>
                    <p>This project challenged me to apply theoretical programming concepts to a real-world problem, enhancing my understanding of data structures, algorithms, and software design principles. It provided valuable hands-on experience developing complex simulations and reinforced my passion for creating innovative solutions through code.                    </p>

                    <p>Worked on this C++ project to make a Hangman game to understand fundamental C++ concepts. I used character arrays and challenged myself to solve without pointers. </p>
                    <p>Employed C++ to construct the Hangman game, leveraging character arrays for data storage while maintaining memory efficiency. Overcame the absence of pointers by devising alternative solutions, fostering a deeper understanding of array manipulation. Incorporated ASCII art to enhance the game's visual appeal, adding a creative touch to the project.</p>
                    <p>Successfully developed a functional Hangman game in C++, showcasing newfound proficiency with character arrays and problem-solving skills. </p>

                    <p>As a dedicated intern at a European company with an AR division in India, I had the opportunity to work on a groundbreaking project that combined augmented reality (AR) technology with web-based advertising for products. Leveraging my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the A-Frame library, I developed a virtual environment of suburbs during my training period. This project received high praise from the company's founder, who recognized it as one of the best projects created by an intern.</p>
                    <p>The goal of this project was to explore the potential of web-based AR for advertising products in a virtual environment. By integrating AR technology into a web-based platform, we aimed to create an immersive and interactive experience for users to engage with various products in a suburban setting.</p>
                    <p>My experience working on this web-based AR advertising project has been immensely rewarding and has provided valuable insights into the intersection of technology and marketing. I am proud to have contributed to the company's innovative initiatives and look forward to exploring more opportunities for leveraging AR technology in advertising and beyond.                    </p>
