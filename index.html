                    <p>Collaborated with a team of four to develop a Monogame project using C# .NET. My specific responsibilities included implementing the firing system and player movement mechanics and contributing to integrating path-finding functionalities.</p>
                    <p>Focused on creating a robust firing system and smooth player movement to enhance the game's interactivity and user experience. </p>
                    <p>Utilized C# .NET within the Monogame framework to develop the designated features, applying object-oriented programming principles for code efficiency and maintainability, and worked closely with team members for effective communication and collaboration. Conducted playtesting sessions to gather audience feedback, iterating on the game mechanics based on user responses.</p>
                    <p>Successfully delivered a polished Monogame project, receiving positive feedback from the audience and instructors during the class presentation. Achieved the overall goal of earning a good grade in the class, reflecting the effectiveness of our teamwork, technical skills, and responsiveness to user feedback.

                    <p>Worked on this C++ project to make a Hangman game to understand fundamental C++ concepts. I used character arrays and challenged myself to solve without pointers. </p>
                    <p>Employed C++ to construct the Hangman game, leveraging character arrays for data storage while maintaining memory efficiency. Overcame the absence of pointers by devising alternative solutions, fostering a deeper understanding of array manipulation. Incorporated ASCII art to enhance the game's visual appeal, adding a creative touch to the project.</p>
                    <p>Successfully developed a functional Hangman game in C++, showcasing newfound proficiency with character arrays and problem-solving skills. </p>
