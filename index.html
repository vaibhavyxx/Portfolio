                <p>I had developed it using Autodesk Maya 3D and Adobe Substance Painter for my final project. I had used <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/starterassets-firstperson-updates-in-new-charactercontroller-pac-196525
                    ">this</a> template to make the gameplay in the unity.</p>
                <P>I had chosen to make an abadoned subway station with graffiti elements as I had tried to add graffitis on the trash cans and have a colorful subway. This project had taught me about 3D Design and its importance on clean geometry. All the assets that are the subway station, subway, rails, benches, trash cans, etc. are designed by me. I wanted to play with Substance Painter as I had added textures from images to make McDonalds advertisements and to make them glow. In addition, I had uv unwrapped them on my own to ensure that the materials sit well on the models. It was a fun project as it taught me how to pick up softwares like Maya quickly and I was able to learn Blender with a similar strategy a lot faster.</P>

                    <p>Worked in a team of two: Edward Choi and Lisa Pham to make a finance based game.
                    Finances are often the most challenging part of being an adult. It is something that can make or break your future, like a good credit score can give you a lower interest on a car and how one should maintain it. However, nobody really teaches finance so we wanted to make a fun immersive game to get children interested in finance and become financially literal.</p>
                    <p>For the first draft of this game, we had tried to use JavaScript's PIXI Library but due to difficulties we had switched it to Unity 2D with C# .Net using GitHub.</p>
                    <p>Initially, we tried to use JavaScript's Pixi Library to make the game on web browser but there was difficulty uploading textures. So, after a few failed attempts, we tried to build this game again with Unity using GitHub for version control. Since, it was our first time using Git simultaneously, we ran into a lot of merge issues which made us make a backup repository. Luckily, most of our merges were solved out and we worked pretty fast to get our barebones done.</p>

                    <p>As a dedicated intern at a European company with an AR division in India, I had the opportunity to work on a groundbreaking project that combined augmented reality (AR) technology with web-based advertising for products. Leveraging my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the A-Frame library, I developed a virtual environment of suburbs during my training period. This project received high praise from the company's founder, who recognized it as one of the best projects created by an intern.</p>
                    <p>The goal of this project was to explore the potential of web-based AR for advertising products in a virtual environment. By integrating AR technology into a web-based platform, we aimed to create an immersive and interactive experience for users to engage with various products in a suburban setting.</p>
                    <p>My experience working on this web-based AR advertising project has been immensely rewarding and has provided valuable insights into the intersection of technology and marketing. I am proud to have contributed to the company's innovative initiatives and look forward to exploring more opportunities for leveraging AR technology in advertising and beyond.                    </p>

                    <p>Developed using Ar.js and A-frame libraries along with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it is a marker-based Web AR project. Since it is a web AR project, I had focused on polycount and stats for the scene to avoid phones from overheating so that everyone could try this experience out. I also wanted to develop my Garden project further into Augmented Reality so I had designed the house via code. I had added a sphere on top which would revolve arounf the house, similar to how in the original project, the UFO revolved in the sky. Adding on, I had ensured that my textures were added to specific faces of the shape so I had use libraries for those things. 
                        For the marker, I had a lot of difficulties in creating one so I had used one from <a href="https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/marker-training/examples/generator.html">this </a> site which would show all these designs.
