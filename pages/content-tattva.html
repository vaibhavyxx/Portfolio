        <h1>UI/UX Branding: ContentTattva</h1>
        <p>This article covers the UX research for redesigning a company's homepage and then making an interactive prototype for it.</p>
    
        <ul>
            <h2>Pain Points</h2>
            <li>Outdated website with content</li>
            <li>Not mobile responsive</li>
            <li>Used placeholder content</li>
            <li>Misaligned company values through brand identity</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <li>Conducted market research to see similar firms made their sites</li>
            <li>Update brand identity with colors, typography and logo</li>
            <li>Delivered a high-fidelity prototype made in Figma</li>
            <li>Collaborated with Wordpress developer to translate their prototype into a functional site</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <h3>Define</h3>
        <span>In the first meeting, the company founders and I discussed the main pillars for the site.</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Identity</li>
            <li>Customer Satisfaction</li>
            <li>Efficiency</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Discover</h3>
            <p>This was the UX period for the site as I had archived all the websites content to learn about them. Then, I conducted market research to analyze the homepages of other firms and find some common functionalities. 
                Some of the features include:
        <ul>
            </p>
            <li>FAQ page to answer potential questions</li>
            <li>Good color scheme to reflect company values</li>
            <li>Single page design</li>
            <li>Use of collapsible menus</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This helped me discover the clear definitions of such sites and how to make it easier for clients to content them.</p>
        
        <h3>Analysis and Planning</h3>
        <p>I had written additional content to tailor with the firm's vision. Additionally, I had made a sitemap and based on that, I had designed wireframes for the site.</p>
        
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>Linked my <a href="">Figma page</a> here to reflect the work. I had also a designed a logo for the brand that they loved it so much, that they adopted it.</p>
        <img width="30%" height="auto" src="../img/projects/content-tattva/ct logo.png">
    
        <h4>Color Scheme</h4>
        <img src="../img/projects/content-tattva/ct1.png" alt="Shades of blue, black and grayish white" width="50%">
        <ul>
            <li>Peace</li>
            <li>Trust</li>
            <li>Modern</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <p>I had conducted several user testing keeping track of user's feedback and make any necessary changes. I had shared a Google Form to record those data.</p>
    
        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p>Delivered a high-fi prototype to the client and then collaborated with a developer to translate it into a website.</p>
