        <h1>how i redesigned contenttattva’s website?</h1>
        <h3>it was summer of 2024, and i wanted learn how to make the company’s new brand identity        </h3>
        <img src="../img/projects/content-tattva/mockup.png" width="80%" height="auto">
        
        <p>Last summer, I was bored and I wanted to learn Figma better. In my spring semester (of 2024), I had worked with a few classmates to make a UI/UX project for a student portal. While we used Axure RP and focused on a lot of design principles, I wanted to challenge myself.</p>
        <p>Hence, over the summer, I spent a few weeks learning how to use Figma properly and effectively by learning about global variables, components, and having a brand identity. After making a few projects to understand my fundamentals, I wanted to try out freelancing. Through connections, I knew a startup with an outdated website and wanted to offer them my services.</p>
        <p>When I first met the founders, I had to do a lot of research on the types of websites they would like to have and what kinds of content should I add. To simplify my research, I followed a UX process where I found the problem, solution and then the discover, define, idea, design and finally testing process.</p>

        <p><span>So, what is the problem?</span></p>
        <p>The problem was the website was old and not responsive with a lot of placeholder content. It did not match the company’s values as they worked as an ERP firm.</p>
        
        <p><span>Then, how did you fix it?</span></p>
        <p>It required a lot of research as I made a new high-fidelity prototype to match the company’s vision, with an updated moodboard, content and even a logo. Finally, I dabbled at Wordpress to replicate the design.</p>
        
        <h2>design process</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h3>define</h3>
        <p>In my first meeting, we had established three pillars of design for this website:
            <ul>
                <li>identity</li>
                <li>customer satisfaction</li>
                <li>efficiency</li>
            </ul>
            They were very proud about their customer service and never having a client walk out of their projects and they wanted their website to convey that. Additionally, they wanted to look chic and elegant to show they’re updated with current times.
        </p>

        <h3>discover</h3>
        <p>Before I went on to change anything, I had documented the website’s contents to know what exactly their services are. During this time, I would have a quick check in with the founders to clarify my doubts and what services they are focusing on for their future. The company initially started as a content writing agency but it evolved into an enterprise resource management firm so we had to slash out a few of its old services. </p>
        <p>While my primary source content was the founders, I also did market research to see how other ERP firms are building their sites. 
            For example, I looked for other ERP startup firms like AppInventiv, Itransition and SAP (of course.) The following features stood out to me about these sites:
            <ul>
                <li>Having an FAQ page to answer your potential clients’ questions</li>
                <li>A good color scheme to reflect your values</li>
                <li>One page design to make it easier to find FAQ, services, clients, experiences and contact us form</li>
                <li>With the last one, the collapsible menu to know about its services and what exactly they offer. </li>
            </ul>    
        </p>

        <p>
            With this research, I noticed that having a clear definition of what you’re offering and multiple ways for clients to contact you can be a great way to improve user experience. Additionally, we needed to add an FAQ page so that required more research.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since this was a one-woman project, I had to envision the brand identity, write some of its content if needed, make prototypes and conduct its testing. 
        </p>

        <h3>analysis & planning</h3>
        <p>
            Now that I have collected all the elements that I might require, I have started working on documentation and writing sample articles. Since I had saved all of the content on a single google docs, I could now go back and see what changes I would make. Some of the changes I had made were -- company’s about page, values, team’s introductions and their services. My rewrites had focused more on what they have achieved and how to accomplish it using the STAR approach (Situation, Task, Action and Result.) By giving concrete examples, I wanted to increase the company’s credibility. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After I had written all the content, I had sent it to their content writer to make sure it is factually correct. While I was waiting for the approach, I started making sitemaps and wireframes to have an idea of how the website would look like. 
        </p>

        <h3>sitemap</h3>

        <h3>wireframes</h3>

        <h3>ux studies</h3>
        <p>With the help of ChatGPT, I had made a few UX studies to know what are the things potential clients would want.</p>
        
        <h4>company profile</h4>
        <p>TechSolutions Inc is a medium sized IT company with 200+ employees and is looking for an ERP solution to streamline their internal processes, manage resources more efficiently to improve overall productivity. </p>
        
        <h4>user profile</h4>
        <p>Alex Ranjan is an Operations Manager in the company. <br>
            His goals are:
            <ul>
                <li>Improve operational efficiency and reduce manual processes.</li>
                <li>Gain real-time insights into a company's performance for informed decision making.</li>
                <li>Enhanced collaboration and communication.</li>
            </ul>
            His pain points are:
            <ul>
                <li>Currently is using manual processes, leading to data inefficiencies.</li>
                <li>Needs a user-friendly solution with intuitive navigation and comprehensive functionalities to meet the company’s diverse needs.</li>
                <li>Frustrated with the lack of integration between different departments which resulted in communication gaps.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>design</h3>
        <!--connect to figma-->
        <p>logo :)</p>
        <img src="../img/projects/content-tattva/logo.png" alt="letters c and t combined to make a happy face" width="50%" height="auto">
        <p>In the inital design, I imagined it to be black but after settling our color scheme, we decided to change the logo's color to LinkedIn blue.</p>
        
        <h4>color scheme</h4>
        <p>Based on our design pillars, I wanted to have blue to reflect trust and peace values of the firm, green was to reflect growth and how their services can help your company grow, black and white to show modernity.</p>
        <img src="../img/projects/content-tattva/ct1.png" alt="Shades of blue, black and grayish white" width="50%">
        <img src="../img/projects/content-tattva/ct2.png" alt="Shades of black, gray and green" width="50%" height="auto">
        <img src="../img/projects/content-tattva/ct3.png" alt="" width="50%" height="auto">
        <img src="../img/projects/content-tattva/ct4.png" alt="" width="50%" height="auto">
        <p>Ultimately, we settled on the first one as it reflected our values of customer satisfaction, growth and peace.</p>

        <h3>prototyping</h3>
        <p>For prototypes, I had made the file in Figma to see how it could reflect in real time.</p>
        <img src="">
        <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/iTzMg2fyMVJQA4gXT2CITJ/Content-tattva-v2?t=3yeB14o3nz79nlaH-1"><img src="../img/social media/figma.png" alt="github" width="8%" height="auto"></a>

        <h3>testing</h3>
        <p>
            I had gone through multiple rounds of testing with the founders to understand how to make changes in the websites. Some of the suggestions that they had mentioned:
            <ul>
                <li>Add more images</li>
                <li>Change the font to make it look more technical</li>
                <li>Make it more colorful</li>
                <li>Add more information about services</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>outcomes</h3>
        <p>Overall, the client was satisfied with my work and wanted to hire a Wordpress developer to convert the file into their actual project. So, I had worked with a developer to make sure it matches the website aesthetics and the newer content is added. I had learned a lot through this process as some of my key takeaways were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be direct and let the client know about your deadlines to make sure that you both are on the same page.</li>
            <li>Know about your skills and be transparent with your client as you both want to make your project better.</li>
            <li>Be flexible as freelancing is a lot about picking up new hats as I had to write content, design elements and more. </li>
            <li>Have fun as design is all about experimenting and trying out new ideas.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, your client would not know what they want and you have to do the detective work to figure it out, so having a few examples of what you are planning on doing before you start can help a lot.</li>
            <li>Always have a backup, you never know if anything goes wrong.</li>
            <li>Don’t assume that your client knows what you are talking about. For example, when I worked with them, I would show them the prototypes on Figma and they would be confused with what Figma does. Take your time to explain to them how it works.</li>
        </ul>
