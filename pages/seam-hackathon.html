        I have always loved hackathons, as they force me to get things done. However, I didn’t think I would be able to finish this hackathon as I didn’t know how to code in TypeScript or React. 
        Granted, I had coded in Javascript and that was all you needed to learn typescript and react quickly.

        Of course, after putting off this hackathon for the past four days, today was the due date, and I decided to get started. For the first hour, I watched some YouTube tutorials to learn how to code in React and TypeScript. After learning a bit of the basics, I looked up Seam’s repository to see what else I needed to get started.

        It told me to download yarn as I have Windows, so I went to git bash and downloaded yarn. Once, I had that, I played around with the app and saw what other games people have made, I started working on mine. Granted, all of that pre-work took me 4 hours and I had 8 hours left to finish the competition.

        Initially, I had big plans as I wanted to make something ‘memorable’ but after understanding my skill sets, I had to scope down and make something that was easy to finish but looked polished enough. So, what started as a drawing app idea ended up being a journaling idea as I wanted users to make silly drawings to show the highlight of their day. Of course, I also wanted ‘stickers’ which are scaled-up emojis.

        After hitting numerous roadblocks of why my code wasn’t working and wanting to give up, I eventually figured it out. I stack overflow my problems or just asked my family and friends if they could help me out with my bug. One way or the other, but by the eleventh hour, I was done and ready to submit it to the competition.

Flash forward, a few weeks later, I ended up being a finalist for the hackathon and my code got published into the app which is now available on Google Play Store and App Store. Though I did not win the contest it was my first solo-hack that I had actually finished and I felt accomplished.
