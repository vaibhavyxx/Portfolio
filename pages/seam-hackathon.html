    <h1>how i made journal app in 12 hours?</h1>
    <h3>it was last august and i wanted to do seam mini-app hackathon</h3>

    <p>
        I have always loved hackathons, as they force me to get things done. However, I didn’t think I would be able to finish this hackathon as I didn’t know how to code in TypeScript or React. 
        Granted, I had coded in Javascript and that was all you needed to learn typescript and react quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, after putting off this hackathon for the past four days, today was the due date, and I decided to get started. For the first hour, I watched some YouTube tutorials to learn how to code in React and TypeScript. After learning a bit of the basics, I looked up Seam’s repository to see what else I needed to get started.
    </p>
    <p>
        It told me to download yarn as I have Windows, so I went to git bash and downloaded yarn. Once, I had that, I played around with the app and saw what other games people have made, I started working on mine. Granted, all of that pre-work took me 4 hours and I had 8 hours left to finish the competition.
    </p>
    <p>
        Initially, I had big plans as I wanted to make something ‘memorable’ but after understanding my skill sets, I had to scope down and make something that was easy to finish but looked polished enough. So, what started as a drawing app idea ended up being a journaling idea as I wanted users to make silly drawings to show the highlight of their day. Of course, I also wanted ‘stickers’ which are scaled-up emojis.
    </p>
    <p>
        After hitting numerous roadblocks of why my code wasn't working and wanting to give up, I eventually figured it out. I stack overflow my problems or just asked my family and friends if they could help me out with my bug. One way or the other, but by the eleventh hour, I was done and ready to submit it to the competition.
    </p>
    <p>
        Flash forward, a few weeks later, I ended up being a finalist for the hackathon and my code got published into the app which is now available on Google Play Store and App Store. Though I did not win the contest it was my first solo-hack that I had actually finished and I felt accomplished.
